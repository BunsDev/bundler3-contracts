# Morpho Blue Bundlers

[Morpho Blue](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue) is a new lending primitive that offers better rates, high capital efficiency and extended flexibility to lenders & borrowers. `morpho-blue-bundlers` hosts the logic that builds alongside the core protocol like MetaMorpho and bundlers.

## Structure

Each Bundler is a domain-specific abstract layer of contract that implements some functions that can be bundled in a single call by EOAs to a single contract. They all inherit from [`BaseBundler`](./src/BaseBundler.sol) that enables bundling multiple function calls into a single `multicall(bytes[] calldata data)` call to the end bundler contract. Each chain-specific bundler is available under their chain-specific folder (e.g. [`ethereum`](./src/ethereum/)).

Some chain-specific domains are also scoped to the chain-specific folder, because they are not expected to be used on any other chain (e.g. DAI and its specific `permit` function is only available on Ethereum - see [`EthereumPermitBundler`](./src/ethereum/EthereumPermitBundler.sol)).

User-end bundlers are provided in each chain-specific folder, instanciating all the intermediary domain-specific bundlers and associated parameters (such as chain-specific protocol addresses, e.g. [`EthereumBundlerV2`](./src/ethereum/EthereumBundlerV2.sol)).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with `yarn`.

Run tests with `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test forge t`.

Note that the `EthereumBundlerV2` has been deployed with 80 000 optimizer runs.
To compile contracts with the same configuration, run `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ethereumBundlerV2 forge b`.

## Audits

All audits are stored in the [audits](./audits/)' folder.

## License

Bundlers are licensed under `GPL-2.0-or-later`, see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).
